## 1. Description

This projects contains a [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook that demonstrates how to calibrate a photon-flux-monitoring system at the High-Intensity Gamma-Ray Source (HIγS) facility [1] of the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) in Durham, NC, USA.
The entire code is written in python.
For more information, see the notebook (for example in github's web interface).

## 2. Prerequisites

* [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
* [python3](https://www.python.org/), in particular the following libraries:
 * [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
 * [numpy](https://numpy.org)
 * [scipy](https://scipy.org)
 * [uncertainties](https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/)

## 3. Usage

Clone the project from github and execute the cells in the `jupyter` notebook.
